# Advent of Code 2024 🎄✨

Welcome to my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024), a series of daily coding challenges during the holiday season! 🎁 Each day, two puzzles are released, and this repository contains my attempts to solve them.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Practice problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.
- Explore various programming techniques and approaches.
- Have fun while getting into the holiday spirit! 🌟

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
The solutions are implemented in:
- **Language**: Python (primary)
- **Libraries/Tools**: 
  - Standard Python libraries for simplicity.
  - Additional libraries may be used if needed (e.g., `numpy`, `pandas` for data-heavy problems).

Feel free to adapt the solutions to your preferred programming language!

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JeromeDesseaux/advent-of-code-2024.git
   cd advent-of-code-2024
   ```

2. Ensure you have Python installed:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

3. Run the solutions for a specific day:
   ```bash
    make part1 DAY=01
    make part2 DAY=01
   ```

   Or run both parts for a specific day:
   ```bash
   make run DAY=01
   ```

4. Test with input data:
   Place the input file (e.g., `input.txt`) in the `input.txt` file. The script should read the file. If not, adjust the code.
